### 0. Introduction to spring framework 5 core library
    the three major Spring 5.0 libraries are spring-core,spring-beans,and spring-context, 
    because the major classes and interfaces for creating the container are found in these libraries. 
    1: BeanFactory
        The basic container that manages objects in Spring is provided by the
        org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanFactory interface and can only be found
        in the spring-beans module
    2: ApplicationContext
       the ApplicationContext,namely the org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext interface,which is sub-interface of BeanFactory.
       the ApplicationContext provides features like message resource handling, AOP capabilities, application-specific contexts,
       and the listener implementation.
       the ApplicationContext,found in spring-context modules, is the one that provides
       an enterprise-specific container for all its applications because it encompasses a larger scope of Spring components than its BeanFactory interface.
